# MYNKSH
###DISCLAIMER
 • Project is just a simulation for a real airline webserver and it can be ONLY used for learning purpose NO MORE
 • The project is built for an university course (Software Engineering- German University in Cairo) under the supervison of University
 • No actual companies or payments were involved, all payments are done in test mode, so no real cards are charged.</p>
### Project Description 
#####This project is done using MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)</h5>
Our team has been hired to build an online reservation system simulation for a virtual airline company. The system will be comprised of a single page web application using mongodb, nodejs, and angular.The application is also extended to support an IOS & Android mobile platform.
<p>The project is hosted using an AWS server through the following link `<b>www.mynksh.com</b>`</p>
<p>
The airline company has initially requested the system support a very basic workflow:
 • Allow any user to specify his/her travel location(s) and dates
 • Provide all available (from/to) flights
 • Select, confirm, and pay for flights
</p>
<p>You can also login in to our <a href='http://www.mynksh.com'>Website</a> and try it. </p>

4. Create a `.env` file having the follwing variables:
  * `JWTSECRET`, the JWT secret key for authentication for the secure APIs, the JWTs can be found in the following directory public>Services so you will need to re-initialize them.
  * `PORT`, port number for application to run on.
  * `MONGODB_URL`, the MongoDB Url for the Database you previously created.
  * `STRIPE_KEY`, Stripe seceret key which you can get from Stripe website for testing prupose.
5. Make sure your MongoDB connection is alive if not start a MongoDB connection `$ sudo service mongod start`.
6. Finally now you ready to start your server, So just type `$ npm start`.

### How to run the Ionic app:
1.  Install Ionic and Cordova on your machine `$ npm install -g cordova ionic`, and run `$ ionic serve --lab`
  * The Ionic is ready to be used on web machine as it is a simulation for a mobile application
